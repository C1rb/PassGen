# PassGen

Hello World!,

     PassGen is a randomly generated password generator, it is written using python. 
     It is my first programming project, and I'm proud that I did it myself.
     I know that this is simple but I really enjoyed coding this.
     
     Feel free to use the code and create pull request to improve my code.
     
     Cheers,
     C1rb
