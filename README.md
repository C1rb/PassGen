# PassGen

PassGen is a randomly generated password generator, it is written using python. 
It is my first programming project, and I'm proud that I did it myself.
I know that this is simple but I really enjoyed coding this.

Version 1.3
- Improved text interface
- No errors

PASSWORD GENERATOR: A randomly generated password generator, the password generated is a 9 character long password.

NOTE!: DO NOT USE THE PASSWORD FOR ANY ACCOUNT(BANK ACCOUNT, GMAIL ACCOUNT OR ANY OTHER ACCOUNT), THIS IS ONLY MADE FOR FUN.

Feel free to use and improve my code.
